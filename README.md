# CDAC FINAL PROJECT

The Gym Management System is a full-stack web application built with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and React.js to streamline membership, workout, and staff management. It ensures secure authentication using JWT-based Spring Security and features role-based access for Admins, Trainers, and Members. The React.js frontend, styled with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS, interacts with a RESTful Spring Boot backend, tested via Postman and documented with Swagger. Git manages version control, ensuring seamless development. This project provides a scalable, secure, and user-friendly solution for efficient gym operations.
